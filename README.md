## Introduction

This code runs an interactive web game app called **Matching Game**. The original [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) was created by Udacity for a course project assessment. The objective of this project from the student perspective, was to write further code, to fulfil the additional Udacity requirements listed at the website link, in the [Background](#background) section.

## Game specifics

When this project is complete. The aim of the game will be to turn over and match all the cards, in the lowest number of moves and shortest time possible.
A move is considered to be done when you have clicked and turned two cards in succession. If they match they will stay turned, if not, then they will move back to unturned.
Inline with the number of moves, a star rating is displayed at a maximum of 3 stars. Taking more than 14 moves will begin to lower the star rating.
You may restart the game at any point, via the circular arrow icon at the top right, above the deck of cards.
Features will be added via the issue log until the project is complete.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure:
1. That your device is connected to the internet, as some styling is retrieved from there.

2. That you have an up to date version installed _(date of writing 08-07-19)_ of any modern web browser for your device e.g. such as _Chrome, Firefox, Safari._
3. That you have extracted all the files in the .zip or from the github repository, into a single folder on your device.
4. Then just open the `index.html` file.
